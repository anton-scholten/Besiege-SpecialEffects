# No C# toolchain is needed. This loads the game's own libmono.so and calls
# Mono.CSharp.CompilerCallableEntryPoint.InvokeCompiler in its mcs.dll, which is
# the exact code path the game uses. gcc is needed once, to build the host.

Build FAILED. The previously built assembly, if any, was left untouched.

If the output above is a list of CS#### errors, that is an ordinary compile
error -- fix the source. Otherwise:

  "the compiler threw a managed exception"
      The exception text is printed above it. Compiling holds the game's whole
      assembly set in memory, so if it is an OutOfMemoryException, close Besiege
      (or anything else large) and try again.

  a SIGSEGV inside Mono.CSharp
      A construct this ancient compiler cannot handle. The known case is any
      `enum` declaration; use int constants instead.
