Done. Next:
  1. Start Besiege and enable "SpecialEffects" in the mods menu.
  2. The four blocks appear in the block menu; search "spot light", "glass",
     "particle emitter" or "text block".
  3. Each block's settings live in its mapper. The Spot Light and the Particle
     Emitter have a menu at the top that switches between pages of controls.
  4. Two console commands come with the mod: "Night true"/"Night false", and
     "Custom <setting> <value>" for the level's fog and ambient light.

Note: the game writes the generated mod ID into Mod.xml the first time it loads
the mod. With a symlink that write lands in your working copy, which is what you
want -- <ID> is meant to stay stable for the life of the mod, so commit it.
